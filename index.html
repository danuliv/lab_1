      <h2>Diving In</h2>
      <p class="first-letter mb-30">
        Geolocation is the art of figuring out where you are in the world and
        (optionally) sharing that information with people you trust. There is
        more than one way to figure out where you are — your IP address, your
        wireless network connection, which cell tower your phone is talking to,
        or dedicated GPS hardware that calculates latitude and longitude from
        information sent by satellites in the sky.

              Q: Geolocation sounds scary. Can I turn it off?<br />
              A: Privacy is an obvious concern when you’re talking about sharing
              <br />
              your physical location with a remote web server. The geolocation
              <br />
              API explicitly states: “User Agents must not send location <br />
              information to Web sites without the express permission of the
              <br />
              user.” In other words, sharing your location is always opt-in. If
              you <br />
              don’t want to, you don’t have to.

      <h2>THE GEOLOCATION API</h2>
      <p class="mb-30">
        The geolocation API lets you share your location with trusted web sites.
        The latitude and longitude are available to JavaScript on the page,
        which in turn can send it back to the remote web server and do fancy
        location-aware things like finding local businesses or showing your
        location on a map.<br /><br />

        As you can see from the following table, the geolocation API is
        supported by most browsers on the desktop and mobile devices.
        Additionally, some older browsers and devices can be supported by
        wrapper libraries, as we’ll see later in this chapter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Along with support for the standard geolocation API, there are a
        plethora of device-specific APIs on other mobile platforms. I’ll cover
        all that later in this chapter.
      </p>
      <span class="ampersand mt-50 mb-50 align-self-center"></span>
      <h2>SHOW ME THE CODE</h2>
      <p class="mb-30">
        The geolocation API centers around a new property on the global
        navigator object: navigator.geolocation.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-30">
        The simplest use of the geolocation API looks like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
		<code>
  function get_location() {
    <mark>navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition</mark>(show_map);
  }
		</code>
	</pre>
      <p>
        That has no detection, no error handling, and no options. Your web
        application should probably include at least the first two of those. To
        detect support for the geolocation API, you can use Modernizr:
      </p>
      <pre>
		<code>
  function get_location() {
  if (<mark>Modernizr.geolocation</mark>) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(show_map);
  } else {
    // no native support; maybe try a fallback?
  }
}
		</code>
	</pre>
      <p class="mb-30">
        What you do without geolocation support is up to you. I’ll explain the
        JavaScript fallback option in a minute, but first I want to talk about
        what happens during that call to getCurrentPosition(). As I mentioned at
        the beginning of this chapter, geolocation support is opt-in. That means
        your browser will never force you to reveal your current physical
        location to a remote server. The user experience differs from browser to
        browser. In Mozilla Firefox, calling the getCurrentPosition() function
        of the geolocation API will cause the browser to pop up an “infobar” at
        the top of the browser window. The infobar looks like this:
      </p>
      <img
        class="align-self-center mb-50"
        src="./image/geolocation-opt-in.png"
        alt="Geolocation opt-in infobar"
        width="737"
        height="32"
      />
      <p>There’s a lot going on here. You, as the end user,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>are told that a website wants to know your location</li>
        <li>are told that a website wants to know your location</li>

        <li>are told that a website wants to know your location</li>
        <li>are told that a website wants to know your location</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Furthermore, this infobar is</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          non-modal, so it won’t prevent you from switching to another browser
          window or tab
        </li>
        <li>
          non-modal, so it won’t prevent you from switching to another browser
          window or tab

        <li>
          non-modal, so it won’t prevent you from switching to another browser

        <li>
          non-modal, so it won’t prevent you from switching to another browser
          window or tab
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You just saw the JavaScript code that causes this infobar to appear.
        It’s a single function call which takes a callback function (which I
        called show_map). The call to getCurrentPosition() will return
        immediately, but that doesn’t mean that you have access to the user’s
        location. The first time you are guaranteed to have location information
        is in the callback function. The callback function looks like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
		<code>
  function show_map(position) {
  var latitude = position.coords.latitude;
  var longitude = position.coords.longitude;
  // let's show a map or do something interesting!
	}
		</code>

        backend positioning server that it talks to. The heading and speed

      <h2>HANDLING ERRORS</h2>
      <p>
        Geolocation is complicated. Things can go wrong. I’ve mentioned the
        “user consent” angle already. If your web application wants the user’s
        location but the user doesn’t want to give it to you, you’re screwed.
        The user always wins. But what does that look like in code? It looks
        like the second argument to the getCurrentPosition() function: an error
        handling callback function.
      </p>
      <pre>
		<code>
	navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
		show_map, <mark>handle_error</mark>)
		</code>
	</pre>
      <p>
        If anything goes wrong, your error callback function will be called with
        a PositionError object.

          <code>TIMEOUT</code> (<code>3</code>) if the network is up but it
          takes too long to calculate the user’s position. How long is “too
          long”? I’ll show you how to define that in the next section.

      <span class="ampersand mt-50 mb-50 align-self-center"></span>
      <h2>CHOICES! I DEMAND CHOICES!</h2>
      <p>
        Some popular mobile devices — like the iPhone and Android phones —
        support two methods of figuring out where you are. The first method
        triangulates your position based on your relative proximity to different
        cellular towers operated by your phone carrier. This method is fast and
        doesn’t require any dedicated GPS hardware, but it only gives you a
        rough idea of where you are. Depending on how many cell towers are in
        your area, “a rough idea” could be as little as one city block or as
        much as a kilometer in every direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I mention this is that, depending on your web application,
        you may not need high accuracy. If you’re just looking for nearby movie
        listings, a “low accuracy” location is probably good enough. There
        aren’t that many movie theaters, even in dense cities, and you’ll
        probably be listing more than one of them anyway. On the other hand, if
        you’re giving turn by turn directions in real time, you really do need
        to know exactly where the user is so you can say “turn right in 20
        meters” or whatever.
      </p>
      <table class="table">

      </table>
      <p>
        The maximumAge property allows the device to answer immediately with a
        cached position. For example, let’s say you call getCurrentPosition()
        for the first time, the user consents, and your success callback
        function is called with a position that was calculated at exactly 10:00
        AM. Exactly one minute later, at 10:01 AM, you call getCurrentPosition()
        again with a maximumAge property of 75000.
      </p>
      <pre>
		<code>
	navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
		success_callback, error_callback, <mark>{maximumAge: 75000}</mark>);
		</code>

        <div class="d-flex flex-column">
          <p>
            Before you ask for the user’s location, you should think about just
            how much accuracy you need, and set enableHighAccuracy accordingly.
            If you need to find their location more than once, you should think
            about how old the information could be and still be useful, and set
            maximumAge accordingly. If you need to find their location
            continuously, then getCurrentPosition() is not for you. You need to
            upgrade to watchPosition().
          </p>
          <p>
            The watchPosition() function has the same structure as
            getCurrentPosition(). It takes two callback functions, a required
            one for success and an optional one for error conditions, and it can
            also take an optional PositionOptions object that has all the same
            properties you just learned about. The difference is that your
            callback function will be called every time the user’s location
            changes. There is no need to actively poll their position. The
            device will determine the optimal polling interval, and it will call
            your callback function whenever it determines that the user’s
            position has changed. You can use this to update a visible marker on
            a map, provide instructions on where to go next, or whatever you
            like. It’s entirely up to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            The watchPosition() function itself returns a number. You should
            probably store this number somewhere. If you ever want to stop
            watching the user’s location change, you can call the clearWatch()
            method and pass it this number, and the device will stop calling
            your callback function. If you’ve ever used the setInterval() and
            clearInterval() functions in JavaScript, this works the same way.

		<code>
	if (geoPosition.init()) {
		geoPosition.getCurrentPosition(geoSuccess, geoError);
	}
		</code>
	</pre>
      <p>
        Let’s take that one step at a time. First, you need to explicitly call
        an <code>init()</code> function. The <code>init()</code> function
        returns <code>true</code> if a supported geolocation <abbr>API</abbr> is
        available.
      </p>
      <pre><code>if (<mark>geoPosition.init()</mark>) {</code></pre>
      <p>
        Calling the <code>init()</code> function does not actually find your
        location. It just verifies that finding your location is possible. To
        actually find your location, you need to call the
        <code>getCurrentPosition()</code> function.
      </p>
      <pre><code>  <mark>geoPosition.getCurrentPosition</mark>(geoSuccess, geo_error);</code></pre>
      <p>
        The <code>getCurrentPosition()</code> function will trigger your browser
        to ask for your permission to find and share your location. If your
        browser natively supports the geolocation <abbr>API</abbr>, it will
        display an infobar at the top of the page asking whether you want to
        share your location with this web site.

      <h2>A COMPLETE, LIVE EXAMPLE</h2>
      <p>
        Here is a live example of using
        <a href="#geo-js"><code>geoPosition.js</code></a> to attempt to get your
        location and display a map of your immediate surroundings:
      </p>
      <img
        src="./image/openclipart.org_johnny_automatic_globe_man.png"
        alt="man with a globe for a head"
        width="194"
        class="align-self-center"
        height="317"
      />
      <span class="align-self-center mb-30"
        >Your browser supports <br />
        geolocation.
        <a href="#">
          Click to look <br />
          up your location</a
        >.</span
      >
      <p>
        If you give your consent to track your location, <em>and</em> the
        backend service was actually able to determine your location,
        <code>geoPosition.js</code> calls the first callback function,
        <code>show_map()</code>, with a single argument, <code>loc</code>. The
        <code>loc</code> object has a <code>coords</code> property which
        contains latitude, longitude, and accuracy information. (This example
        doesn’t use the accuracy information.) The rest of the
        <code>show_map()</code> function uses the Google Maps API to set up an
        embedded map.
      </p>
      <pre>
		<code>
function show_map(loc) {
	$("#geo-wrapper").css({'width':'320px','height':'350px'});
	var map = new GMap2(document.getElementById("geo-wrapper"));
	var center = new GLatLng(<mark>loc.coords.latitude</mark>, <mark>loc.coords.longitude</mark>);
	map.setCenter(center, 14);
	map.addControl(new GSmallMapControl());
	map.addControl(new GMapTypeControl());
	map.addOverlay(new GMarker(center, {draggable: false, title: "You are here (more or less)"}));
}
		</code>
  </pre>
      <p>
        How does it work? Let’s take a look. On page load, this page calls
        <code>geoPosition.init()</code> to determine whether geolocation is
        available through any of the interfaces that
        <code>geoPosition.js</code> supports. If so, it sets up a link you can
        click to look up your location. Clicking that link calls the
        <code>lookup_location()</code> function, shown here:
      </p>
